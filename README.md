# Rubble: An implicit code for simulating the local evolution of solid size distributions in protoplanetary disks

## Installation

You may install `Rubble` by this command:

```bash
pip install -U rubble
```

Or, you may try the most updated `Rubble` by this command:

```bash
pip install -U -e git+git://github.com/astroboylrx/Rubble
```

It will automatically install all the required modules. Also, if you are using Intel processors, please use [Intel Distribution for Python](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/distribution-for-python.html) or at least `intel-numpy` and `intel-scipy`, which will speed up the program for one or two order of magnitudes.

# Usage

Check out the Jupyter Notebooks under the `doc` folder. More examples will be added soon.
